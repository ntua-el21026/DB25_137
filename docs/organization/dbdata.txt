- Each festival spans 1–3 days with 5–15 events per day
- Performances have durations 30–180 minutes with required breaks between
- Equipment is shared across stages but not duplicated unnecessarily
- Staff covers technical, security, and support roles; security staff = at least 5% of audience size, support = 2%
